Greetings,

This is the repository for the samples.

Images from the Guggenheim Flickr Photostream are retrieved through the Flickr API and displayed in galleries organized by select tags. A class guggFlickrImg was created for the image object using PHP.

Please visit http://soseditions.com/gugg/guggFlickrGallery.php for a demonstration.

Thank you.
